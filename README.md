This project was done for NIS Game Jam for gamification of health, safety and environment training of employees.

Notes:
- Code is mostly not optimized or how I think it should be written for production.
- I made this public because I wanted to share how I do quick prototyping on tight deadline.
- I didn't follow DRY and YAGNI in this case, because it slows down prototyping - harder to refactor in case we pivot. And prototypes pivot a lot.
- Commits are not clean as well. :)
